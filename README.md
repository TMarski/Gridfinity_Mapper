# Gridfinity_Mapper
A vibe-coded drag-and-drop graphical HTML web app for planning and tracking Gridfinity drawer layouts, because I needed a flexible way of tracking my Gridfinity hardware drawers. 
It's just HTML, so you can <a href="https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/TMarski/Gridfinity_Mapper/blob/main/Gridfinity_Mapper.html">try it out live in your browser!</a>

For those unaware, Gridfinity, described as "the modular, open-source grid storage system", is a whole storage ecosystem which uses 3D printed bins to store items on grid of 42mm cells. It has totally transformed my garage.
You can learn more about the Gridfinity specification at <a href="https://gridfinity.xyz/">Gridfinity.xyz</a>.


# Features
- A graphical drag-and-drop UI for quickly rearranging your bins
- A hierachical system based on "Drawers" and "Bins". Create a drawer of any given grid size, then create bins of specific X and Y sizes within those drawers.
- Assign custom colors to your bins (mine are all orange, but yours can be any color you want).
- Add custom attributes to each bin, such as hardware specifications, Amazon product URLs, or any other detail you want to track
- Import and export as JSON, allowing you to backup your layouts, edit them in other applications, or perhaps even use a custom LLM tool calling process to query an AI about your inventory (more details on that coming soon)
