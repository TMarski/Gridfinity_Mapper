I needed a flexible way of tracking my Gridfinity hardware drawers. This simple HTML5 web app includes the following features:
- A graphical drag-and-drop UI for quickly rearranging your bins
- A hierachical system based on "Drawers" and "Bins". Create a drawer of any given grid size, then create bins of specific X and Y sizes within those drawers.
- Assign custom colors to your bins (mine are all orange, but yours can be any color you want).
- Add custom attributes to each bin, such as hardware specifications, Amazon product URLs, or any other detail you want to track
- Import and export as JSON, allowing you to backup your layouts, edit them in other applications, or perhaps even use a custom LLM tool calling process to query an AI about your inventory (more details on that coming soon)
